# airline-customer-satisfaction
#Overview

This project analyzes airline reviews to predict passenger satisfaction and extract service insights using EDA, NLP, and Machine Learning. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to classify reviews based on customer sentiment.

#Dataset
The dataset includes various columns such as:

Review Details: Airline name, customer reviews, ratings (overall, seat comfort, cabin service, etc.)

Passenger Details: Traveller type (Solo, Family, Business, etc.), Cabin class (Economy, Business, First, etc.)

Flight Details: Route, Date flown, Aircraft type

#Technologies Used
Programming: Python

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

NLP & Feature Engineering: NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob, TF-IDF

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

#Features & Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding customer behavior through statistical analysis and visualizations.

Text Preprocessing – Cleaning reviews (removing stopwords, punctuation, and URLs).

Feature Engineering – Creating new features such as sentiment scores, review length, and POS tagging.

Model Training – Training various ML models to classify reviews as positive or negative.

Insights & Business Impact – Identifying key factors affecting airline satisfaction and areas for improvement.

#Results & Insights
Key drivers of customer satisfaction include cabin service, seat comfort, and value for money.

Text analysis revealed common pain points such as delayed flights, rude staff, and uncomfortable seating.

Machine learning models achieved an accuracy of X% (mention your best model performance) in predicting customer sentiment.
